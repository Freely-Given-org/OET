                        suggestions. I'm also wanting to make it open in the
                        sense of open for others to join in and help with (but
                        that doesn’t mean that it would be open to everyone—just
                        those who show a genuine interest and ability).

                        language qualifier out of the title of a Bible
                        translation, although it is true that in most cases that
                        language of the title itself indicates the language of
                        the translation.)

                        (Again it seems a little deficient to me if a book
                        called something like

                    The OET translation has been on hold for several years as
                    we’ve worked on other projects. However, we expect serious

                </h2>
                <p class='FAQAnswer'>
                    Well, Christians have a long history of devotion to the task
                    of making the Bible available in a language that people can
                    easily understand -- many suffered and some even died in
                    their zeal to make the Scriptures available to others.
                </p>
                <p class='FAQAnswer'>
                    However, assuming that you’re really asking about ENGLISH
                    translations here, there are two main reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Language changes.</b> Words change meaning. Some old
                        words and grammatical forms drop out of common use. Some
                        old words gain new shades of meaning and new words are
                        introduced. So a dated translation may not speak well to
                        the current generation and new translations are
                        required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Translations target a particular audience.</b>
                        There are many decisions to be made when doing a
                        translation, and the translators usually follow a series
                        of policies which are decided by thinking about what
                        audience they are hoping to reach. The best Bible for a
                        teenager to use for personal reading and devotions may
                        not be the same one that a Bible teacher will want to
                        preach from. Protestants may make different translation
                        decisions from Catholics, and similarly for other
                        distinct groups. A publishing company might want to
                        target a certain segment of the market. Hence, many
                        different translations arise.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class='FAQAnswer'>
                    Someone once said, “
                    <em>
                        Reading a translation is like looking at the back of a
                        tapestry.
                    </em>
                    ” While we strongly encourage the study of the Jewish and
                    Christian scriptures in the original languages, this isn’t
                    practical for everyone. Hence we need translations into our
                    modern languages despite the shortfalls (and potential
                    confusion).

                        It is freely available and can be used on paper as well
                        as in all media and digital productions; even used as a
                        base for a derivative work

                    <li>
                        The OET consists of multiple versions with different
                        goals and purposes that are intended to be used together
                        as a set

                    <li>
                        Because it’s not a profit-making venture, it can afford
                        to deviate from some (unfortunate or outdated) past
                        translation precedents and traditions without being
                        concerned about any offence creating a shortfall of
                        sales.

                <p class='FAQAnswer'>
                    Although these names are indeed very familiar, they are
                    often confusing and somewhat misleading for modern readers.
                    In current useage, we really are only likely to use the term{' '}
                    <em>Testament</em>
                    when we're talking about someone's will. Also, the term{' '}
                    <em>New</em> might wrongly imply that the <em>Old</em>
                    is no longer relevant. Hence the OET actively tries to
                    discard this terminology.

                    Have you heard someone say, "This verse says, ..."? Well,
                    verses are a purely artificial (and not particularly well

                    themselves don’t <em>say</em> anything! They are useful for
                    guiding people to the correct area of the Bible, but
                    unfortunately they have also greatly assisted in the
                    unfortunate habit of people quoting short Bible segments
                    completely out of context. Since the OET aims to try to head
                    in a new direction, we want to discourage the use of small
                    snippets out of context, and this is one way that we can
                    help do it.

                    Why does the OET have funny characters in the files?
                </h2>
                <p class='FAQAnswer'>
                    The Literal Version (OET-LV) uses underline characters to
                    join words which are represented by one word in the original
                    language. For example, <em>he_said</em> would indicate that
                    these two English words are represented by just one word in
                    the original language and there is no separate word
                    specifying who is the <em>he</em>. The OET also includes
                    grammatical and semantic tagging. For example, if the text
                    says <em>gave it to him</em> the OET will attempt to mark or
                    tag what the <em>it</em> is and who the <em>him</em> is.
                    This tagging is done in the text files using special
                    characters, e.g., <em>him=PDavid</em> tells us that the{' '}
                    <em>him</em> referred to is the person David. A full list of
                    tags and special characters can be found{' '}

                    Why does the OET have the books in a different order?
                </h2>
                <p class='FAQAnswer'>
                    Well yeah, tradition is a wonderful thing, and you can be
                    assured that there will be a variant with some more
                    traditional design decisions like the traditional book
                    order. However, there’s also no need to be shackled to
                    tradition. Remember that many Bible "books" started as
                    individual scrolls. Some writings were split so those
                    scrolls wouldn’t be too physically big and heavy, and we may
                    join them togther again, e.g., 1 &amp; 2 Samuel. The default
                    OET New Testament will begin with John’s account, which also
                    has the advantage of placing Luke’s two accounts right after
                    each other.

                    Actually, it’s release <em>dates</em> since there’s five
                    versions. It is planned to develop the Literal Version, the
                    Readers’ Version, and the Colloquial Version simultaneously,
                    and we hope to make some preliminary books available by the
                    end of 2022, with the Old Testament being released by the
                    end of 2025. The Study Version and the Extended Version will
                    also be developed together, but not until after the V1.0.0
                    release of the first three versions, so no time frame is
                    available for them yet. But if we can recruit more{' '}

                    Yes, we call that the <em>woody</em> feeling. The OET-LV is
                    designed to closely follow the wording used in the original
                    languages, instead of using modern English expressions. This
                    makes it appear to sound <em>old-fashioned</em>, but the
                    reason for leaving it that way is to help the serious
                    student be able to get a good look at what is actually
                    written in the originals. Use the <b>Readers’ Version</b> if
                    you want something that’s nicer to read.
